KettlebellWorkout
=================
KettlebellWorkout is designed for kettlebell sport athletes to use during training sessions. It allows you to specify
both the duration of a training set and the numer of reps per minute.

Settings
--------
The app opens on the settings screen where you can define the workout that you want to perform. There are three controls
to set. Whenever you open the app it will remember the last workout settings that you used.

The three settings for your workout are:
  - Duration - The number of minutes that the session will run for
  - Pace - The number of reps you will perform per minute
  - Anounce Minutes - When _ON_ the app will verbally announce each completed minute. When _OFF_ there will be no announcements for completed minutes

When the settings are right you can press the start button and the workout will begin

Workout
-------

The workout will start with a 10 second countdown to allow you to prepare for the first rep. Each second of the countdown will
beep. After the 10 second countdown completes there will be a bell to indicate the start of the actual workout. The sounds are
so that you don't need to watch the app to know when to start.

During the actual workout there are two displays to show your progress:
  - The Rep Counter - This is a large display of the number of reps that you have performed so far
  - Time Elapsed - The time since the workout began

Each rep will be marked by a sound so that you won't need to watch the app for the entire workout. Whenever a minute
is completed an optional announcement will let you know how many minutes are done. There is also an announcement when the
workout completes.

During the countdown and workout there is a _PAUSE_ button enabled, which pauses the timer. When the timer is paused you can
either _RESUME_ the workout or _RESET_ the workout duration or pace by returning to the settings screen. Returning to the settings
screen will lose the current workout progress.
